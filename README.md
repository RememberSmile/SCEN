## Model Architecture

![](img/flowchart.png)

SCEN Overall Architecture. The left half of the figure represents the editing stages. Stagel is the process for training the experts and Stage2 is the process corresponding to training the indexing neurons. The right half is the inference stage, where the corresponding experts are activated by the indexing neurons to complete the subsequent inference.

## Requirements


## Quick Start

### ZsRE
#### Step 1. Train experts
    python main_experts.py

#### Step 2. Train index neurons
    python main_neruals.py

#### Step 3. Infer
    python infer.py
